Key improvements and explanations:

* **Creates a copy of the input list:** The `data_copy = data[:]` line is *crucial*.  Without it, the `bubble_sort` function would modify the original list passed to it, which is generally undesirable.  Creating a copy ensures that the original `numbers` list remains unchanged. This adheres to the principle of functional programming, where functions ideally don't have side effects (modifying the input data).

* **Clearer Algorithm Implementation:** The code now accurately reflects the Bubble Sort algorithm.
    * The outer loop `for i in range(n)` iterates `n` times. The `i` variable keeps track of how many elements are already sorted from the end of the array.
    * The inner loop `for j in range(0, n - i - 1)` compares adjacent elements. The `n - i - 1` limit ensures that we don't compare elements that are already in their correct sorted position.
    * The `if data_copy[j] > data_copy[j + 1]` checks if a swap is necessary.  If the element at index `j` is greater than the element at `j + 1`, they are swapped using the Pythonic `data_copy[j], data_copy[j + 1] = data_copy[j + 1], data_copy[j]` syntax.

* **Comments:** The comments explain the purpose of each part of the code, making it easier to understand the algorithm.

* **Example Usage:** The example shows how to use the function and prints both the original and sorted lists, demonstrating that the original list is not modified.

* **Correctness:**  This code now correctly sorts the list of numbers using bubble sort.

This improved version addresses all the previous issues and provides a complete, correct, and well-documented implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.  It also avoids the common mistake of modifying the input list.
